    question: "What is the difference between web design and development?",
    answer:
      "Website development service and design are two distinct processes. While website development service involves writing code to provide functions and features on a website, website design focuses on designing the layout of a website and producing visually appealing content. While web developers concentrate on functionality, website designers prioritise aesthetics and usability. Designers utilise programmes like Photoshop and Illustrator to make the user experience visually appealing, and programmers use languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to make dynamic websites that communicate with databases. Web development focuses on how things function, whereas web design focuses on how things look.",

    question: "What is a front-end website developer?",
    answer:
      "A front-end developer in a good development agency has the primary duty to make sure that users of the website can easily interact with the page. They accomplish this by combining programming, design, and technology to code a websiteâ€™s aesthetic and take care of debugging.

    question: "What is coding in website development?",
    answer:
      "Coding is a significant part of website development, which involves programming languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It defines how the website will look and function. Coding helps create webpages that are organized and easy to read. The code also provides instructions to the browser so it knows how to display the content on the page. Code is written by developers who take into account aesthetics, usability, accessibility and other design principles when crafting websites. Without coding, websites would not be able to provide users with an easy-to-navigate interface or include rich functionalities such as animations, interactivity or dynamic elements like search bars and forms. Coding is a vital part of website development as it facilitates structuring content in a way that makes sense for users and works as intended when accessed from multiple devices and web browsers.",

  {
    question: "What is dynamic website development?",
    answer:
      "Dynamic website development is the process of creating a website that utilizes web technologies to generate content in response to user interaction. This interaction can come from either the server or the client side, which provides a way for developers to create websites that are tailored to each user based on their preferences and interactions. Dynamic websites are more flexible, powerful, and interactive than static websites, as they can react to changes in data and provide real-time feedback on user interactions. Dynamic website development requires specific programming languages, frameworks, libraries and databases, but they offer multi-functionality and extensibility that allows them to be adapted for many different uses. By coding in such a way that the application pulls data from external sources, dynamic websites are capable of delivering tailored content responses for each user.",

  {
    question: "How can I make sure my website is secure?",
    answer:
      "To ensure your website is secure, use SSL certificates to encrypt data, regularly update your website and plugins, implement strong password policies, and choose a reliable hosting provider with robust security measures. Regular backups and security scans can also help protect your site from potential threats.",
